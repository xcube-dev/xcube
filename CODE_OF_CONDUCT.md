# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment 
for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, 
religion, or any other characteristic.

We expect everyone to treat each other with respect and kindness. We do not 
tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, 
please report it to the project maintainers immediately.

Thank you for helping us create a welcoming community!
