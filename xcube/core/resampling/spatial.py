    Resample a dataset *source_ds* in the spatial dimensions.

    If the source grid mapping *source_gm* is not given,
    it is derived from *dataset*:
    ``source_gm = GridMapping.from_dataset(source_ds)``.

    If the target grid mapping *target_gm* is not given,
    it is derived from *source_gm* as
    ``target_gm = source_gm.to_regular()``,
    or if target dataset *ref_ds* is given as
    ``target_gm = GridMapping.from_dataset(ref_ds)``.

    New in 1.6: If *ref_ds* is given, its coordinate
    variables are copied by reference into the returned
    dataset.

    If *source_gm* is almost equal to *target_gm*, this
    function is a no-op and *dataset* is returned unchanged.

    Otherwise, the function computes a spatially
    resampled version of *dataset* and returns it.

    Using *var_configs*, the resampling of individual
    variables can be configured. If given, *var_configs*
    must be a mapping from variable names to configuration
    dictionaries which can have the following properties:

    * ``spline_order`` (int) - The order of spline polynomials
        used for interpolating. It is used for up-sampling only.
        Possible values are 0 to 5.
        Default is 1 (bi-linear) for floating point variables,
        and 0 (= nearest neighbor) for integer and bool variables.
    * ``aggregator`` (str) - An optional aggregating
        function. It is used for down-sampling only.
        Examples are ``numpy.nanmean``, ``numpy.nanmin``,
        ``numpy.nanmax``.
        Default is ``numpy.nanmean`` for floating point variables,
        and None (= nearest neighbor) for integer and bool variables.
    * ``recover_nan`` (bool) - whether a special algorithm
        shall be used that is able to recover values that would
        otherwise yield NaN during resampling.
        Default is False for all variable types since this
        may require considerable CPU resources on top.

    Note that *var_configs* is only used if the resampling involves
    an affine transformation. This is true if the CRS of
    *source_gm* and CRS of *target_gm* are equal and one of two
    cases is given:

    1. *source_gm* is regular.
       In this case the resampling is the affine transformation.
       and the result is returned directly.
    2. *source_gm* is not regular and has a lower resolution
       than *target_cm*.
       In this case *dataset* is down-sampled first using an affine
       transformation. Then the result is rectified.

    In all other cases, no affine transformation is applied and
    the resampling is a direct rectification.

    Args:
        source_ds: The source dataset.
        source_gm: The source grid mapping.
        target_gm: The target grid mapping. Must be regular.
        ref_ds: An optional dataset that provides the
            target grid mapping if *target_gm* is not provided.
            If *ref_ds* is given, its coordinate variables are copied
            by reference into the returned dataset.
        var_configs: Optional resampling configurations
            for individual variables.
        encode_cf: Whether to encode the target grid mapping
            into the resampled dataset in a CF-compliant way.
            Defaults to ``True``.
        gm_name: Name for the grid mapping variable.
            Defaults to "crs". Used only if *encode_cf* is ``True``.
        rectify_kwargs: Keyword arguments passed func:`rectify_dataset`
            should a rectification be required.


    Returns: The spatially resampled dataset, or None if the requested
        output area does not intersect with *dataset*.
