"""Utilities to ensure compatibility between time variables and their indexers

The utilities in this module check and, where necessary, modify time indexers
to ensure that they are compatible with the variables they are indexing.
"Compatibility" in this case refers to timezone-awareness: a timezone-aware
indexer cannot index a timezone-naive variable, and vice versa. Since xcube
processes data from external sources, we need a generalized way to ensure
this compatibility before attempting an indexing operation. See
https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube/issues/605 for more background information.

    the start and stop fields are valid timestamps. For a slice, the start

    The compatibility check consists of checking the timezone-awareness
    of the variable and its indexer. If the variable is timezone-aware and
